# research-paper-2021

In this repository are both full-size images and code excerpts for my 2021 research paper. The full-size images include plots for K-Means clustering, correlation coefficients and p-values, and visualizations of the available strain and genetic expression data sets. The code excerpts include strain filtering, K-Means categorization and calculating correlation coefficient and p-values.
